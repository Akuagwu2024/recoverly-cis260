## Overview

Recoverly is a student-built Lost & Found platform designed to serve all seven City Colleges of Chicago. It began as a class project at Kennedy-King and is now being developed into a working prototype for campus-wide use.

The goal is straightforward:  
**Help students, staff, and faculty report, search, and recover lost items.**

- Post a **Lost** or **Found** item
- Search by **name, location, or category**
- Connect securely without sharing personal info
- Share recovery stories to inspire others

---

## Pages

- **Contact** – Send feedback or share success

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (custom theme), JavaScript
- **Backend (planned):** Node.js, MongoDB
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, GitHub

## CCC Integration

Recoverly is designed to be adaptable for each CCC campus:
