# Recoverly – Lost & Found Hub

## Built for the City Colleges of Chicago

**Course:** CIS 260 – Web Development  
**Prototype Origin:** Kennedy-King College  
**Project Lead:** Zitta Gardell-Norwood

---

## Overview

Recoverly is a student-built Lost & Found platform designed to serve all seven City Colleges of Chicago. It began as a class project at Kennedy-King and is now being developed into a working prototype for campus-wide use.

The goal is straightforward:  
**Help students, staff, and faculty report, search, and recover lost items.**

---

## Why It Matters

Every day, someone misplaces something important — keys, phones, IDs, books. Recoverly makes it easier to:

- Post a **Lost** or **Found** item  
- Search by **name, location, campus, or category**  
- Connect securely without sharing personal info  
- Share recovery stories to inspire others  
- Track reunited items with a live counter  

---

## Pages

- **Home (`index.html`)** – Overview, sidebar navigation, success stories, and community counter  
- **Report (`report.html`)** – Submit a lost/found item (with campus + category + optional CCC email)  
- **Search (`search.html`)** – Browse and filter listings by status, campus, category, and sort order  
- **Dashboard (`dashboard.html`)** – Staff-only view to filter, mark items reunited, and delete reports  
- **Contact (`contact.html`)** – Send feedback or share success (CCC email verification hint)  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (custom theme), JavaScript  
- **Backend (planned):** Node.js, MongoDB  
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages  
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, GitHub Codespaces  

---

## CCC Integration

Recoverly is designed to be adaptable for each CCC campus:

- Custom colors and logos  
- Local contact info  
- Campus-specific listings  

Kennedy-King College is the pilot version, using maroon and gray to reflect its identity.
