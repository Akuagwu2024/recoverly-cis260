**4. Reflection:**  
Developing Recoverly helped me understand Git branching and file management. Uploading the proposal and organizing the repo worked well. I had trouble with the pull request setup initially, but resolved it by adding a file to the feature branch. One Git/GitHub concept I’d like to learn more about is managing multiple branches and merge conflicts.
