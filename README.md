# Recoverly – Lost & Found Hub

This is the **Recoverly** project for CIS 260. It is a community-based platform for reporting and recovering lost and found items. The website will feature:
- A homepage to navigate and introduce the platform
- A form to report lost or found items
- A search functionality to browse lost/found items
- A contact system to ensure privacy

### Technologies Used:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB
- Responsive Design: Tailwind CSS
- Map Integration: Google Maps API

### Project Structure:
- **/public**: Contains static files (HTML, CSS, JS)
- **/models**: MongoDB models
- **/routes**: Backend routes for handling requests
- **/server**: The main server setup


**4. Reflection:**  
Developing Recoverly helped me understand Git branching and file management. Uploading the proposal and organizing the repo worked well. I had trouble with the pull request setup initially, but resolved it by adding a file to the feature branch. One Git/GitHub concept I’d like to learn more about is managing multiple branches and merge conflicts.
